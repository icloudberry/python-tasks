# python-tasks
Here I would put some solutions for programming tasks in python

1. Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

fibbonacci.py

2. Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

prime-factor.py

NOTE: good candidate to practice performance measurements etc!!!
